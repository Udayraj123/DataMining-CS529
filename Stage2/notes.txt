Complexity for all below is O(V . VlogV)

 Node based topological similarity (local) == Topological Neighbourhood Based Methods (Local)

Common Neighbor (CN)
> Number of common neighbors between x,y

Jacard Coefficient (JC)
> Intersection/Union i.e Common Neighbors / Total Neighbors 
> All values are fractions < 1

Adamic Adar (AA)
> Sum(1/log(edges(Zi))) over all common neighbors Z
> If "triangle closing" is a frequent mechanism by which edges form in a social network,
	>  Within common nghs of x and y, A node with more neighbours is less likely to introduce x and y than a node with less neighbours.

Resource Allocation(RA)
> Sum(1/|edges(Zi)|) over all common neighbors Z
> 

Preferential Attachment (PA)
> product of no of edges of u and v
> this similarity index has the lowest computational complexity.

 Path based topological similarity (global)

Hitting time (HT)
> Hx,y from x to y is the expected number of steps required for a random walk starting at x to reach y.

Rooted pagerank (RP)
> Random walks from x to y will be terminated/reset with fixed probabilty alpha at each step; in this way, distant parts of the graph will almost never be explored.

AUC = P( p1.score > p2.score and p1 is existing and p2 is non-existing ) + 0.5*P( p1.score = p2.score and ..)
	= count(score above + 0.5 score equal)/ len(non existing)
above value is averaged over all node pairs
